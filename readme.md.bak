HComms stands for "Human Communications". This application

capabilities that advanced users have used for eons. A specific list
is below:

 - Schedule other program's executions
    - Linux users have `atd` and `cron`, windows has a `Scheduled Tasks` UI,
      but these are not simple. `hcomms` aims to make scheduling
      tasks simple by breaking the steps into "create task X" and then "schedule task X".
 - Discover other `hcomms` users:
    - on the local network
    - using a public `hcomms` server as an intermediary
 - Identify other `hcomms` users:
    - This is the largest hurdle; I need to make PKI simple enough for anyone to use,
      and ideally this would talk to U2F devices so users can physically plug keys in
      without the risk of misplacing a key file inside their systems.
    - 
 - Send data to/from other `hcomms` users:
    - binary data

they act in concert (even when competing for the same resources),
and this in turn generates intelligent
