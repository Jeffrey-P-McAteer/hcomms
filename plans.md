# Plans/Goals

This is a more formal to-do list,
and every feature added should rest here for
a few weeks before being implemented.


 - [x] Cross-compiled CLI binary that only depends on `libc`/`kernel.dll`/etc.
 - [ ] Read `hcomms.toml` from CWD or `~/.hcomms.toml` (even on windows)
 - [ ] Store data in a `hcomms.db` or `~/.hcomms.db` (based on location of first `hcomms.toml` file found)
 - [ ] Cross-platform GUI
  - See [ui-plans.md](ui-plans.md)
